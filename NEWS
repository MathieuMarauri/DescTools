DescTools 0.99.10 (2015-03-15)
-----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * SaveAs brings up file.choose for saving a R object.
   * Explore is back again, as the package "manipulate" is on CRAN meanwhile.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * The date functions have been changed to use as.POSIXlt for better performance.
   * DrawBand will accept matrices of coordinates.
   * Impute gets other default values. Now the median(x, na.rm=TRUE) will be used.
   * Small and Large have been redesigned to run faster.
   * Calculation of winsorized variance, used for confidence intervals for trimmed
     means in MeanCI, is much faster for large x.
   * Format code restrictions for dates have been formulated more liberal such as 
     to allow formats like "yyyymmdd".   
   * Desc.numeric will not refuse to describe numeric vectors with additional classes.	  
	 

BUGFIXES:
   * XLGetRange's call attribute would only have returned the header instead of the 
     address(es) of the selected range(s).
   * Desc.table for higher dimensional tables does not any more report 
     erroneously ChiSquare-Test results 	 
   * Correcting several issues with new R-Devel	 
	 


DescTools 0.99.9 (2015-01-20)
-----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:

   * PlotTernary creates triangle plots.
   * CartToSph, SphToCart convert cartesian coordinates into spherical ones.

     winsorized variances.

   * DenseRank calculates consecutive ranks without ties.
   * XLKill kills a hidden XL task, which can't be closed otherwise.
   * Agree quantifies the agreement of several raters.
   * PostHocTest gets a new interface for tables, performing pairwise ChiSq-tests
     with the option to adjust p-values for multiple testing.
   * PostHocTest gains a new option "duncan", computing Duncan's MRT   
   * Dunn's test of multiple comparisons using rank sums added (DunnTest).
   * DunnettTest performs a Dunnett multiple comparisons test.
   * lines.smooth.spline does for this smoother, what lines.loess did for loess.	 
   * RndPairs returns pairs of correlated random numbers.
   * BubbleLegend creates a legend for bubble plots.
   * Format combines the functionality of the old functions FormatFix and FormatSig 
     and adds some extensions like leading zeros and dates.
   * CCC calculates Lin's concordance correlation coefficient for agreement.
   * CoefVar yields the coefficient of variation and its confidence limits.
   * CohenD calculates Cohen's effect size d and its confidence limits.
   * BinomRatioCI calculates confidence intervals for the ratio of binomial and 
     multinomial proportions. 
   * The new function Overlap returns the extent of the overlapping part of two ranges.	 
   
   
UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * Min has been renamed to Minute and Sec to Second.
   * Hour, Minute, Second do accept POSIXct times now. 
   * CorCI loses the argument *twotailed* and gains the argument *alternative*.
     This is following the logic in other test- and CI-functions.
   * Assocs has been redesigned to run faster (but it still has accelerating potential..)
   * Untable has been extended to support frequency form of tables (a data.frame 
     with levels of the factors and a "Freq" column).
   * XLGetRange returns the full call statement as attribute.
   * OddsRatio will be calculated as log OR instead of simple OR, allowing bigger n.
     (Well, David Meyer has been there long before, as I noticed lately...)
   * AddMonths accepts a vector of dates.
   * Trim accepts integer values on the argument trim. The function returns NA instead
     of median(x), if trim is set to a value > 0.5, resp. n/2.
   * Desc.table now reports missing values, if there are any.	 
   * Desc.data.frame accepts a main vector, allowing the user to define his own main captions.
   * Lorenz curve function Lc gains a formula interface for creating groupwise curves.
   * PlotBubble gains a formula interface and some more arguments, e.g. args.legend.
   * Mround has been renamed to RoundM, and gains a new argument FUN which allows 
     to define the rounding function (ceiling, floor, ..).
   * EtaSq has been extended by Daniel Wollschlaeger (thanks).
   * BinomCI uses rownames now. It gains further a new method "pratt".
   * PlotVenn gains a new argument "labels". The argument "plot" has been renamed to "plotit" 
     (to be consistent with the package naming rules).

   * ICC gains a new argument "type" to choose a specific type of ICC.
   * Agreement functions KendallW, KappaM, ICC, CronbachAlpha etc. have been harmonised.
   * AreaIdent has been renamed to IdentifyA (which seems to be more intuitive).
   * MeanCI has been enhanced to calculate confidence intervals for trimmed means.
   * StrVal gains two new arguments paste and as.numeric.
   * Many smaller changes on the documentation and helpfiles.
   * PairApply argument "symmetric" gets another default value: "FALSE" instead of "TRUE". 
     This seems more robust, as the other way round potential errors are more likely.
   
   
DEFUNCT:
   * WhichNumerics, WhichFactors, WhichFlags are not needed anymore. 
     which(sapply(x, IsNumeric)), sapply(x, IsDichotmous), sapply(x, is.factor) do the job.
   * DescFactFact is a relict and obsolete. Use of Desc.formula or Desc.table is recommended.
   * FormatFix and FormatSig have been replaced by the new function Format.
   * Explore has been removed because of its dependency for the package "manipulate"
     (which is not on CRAN). It might be added again built on tcltk down the road.
   
   
BUGFIXES:
   * plotit was not correctly interpreted in Desc.factor (credits to Thomas Schlesinger). 	 
   * PlotVenn did not correctly place the figures in the 2-sample case (credits to Andrew Marritt).

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * Outlier has been changed to strictly following the boxplot logic.
   * DescToolsOptions gains a default argument allowing to reset the options.
   * WrdText allows to set some paragraph format and text color now.

BUGFIXES:
   * anyNA is only defined for R >= 3.1, the according dependency has been defined.
   * the key.ico file has been placed in /extdata directory and should now definitely 
     be found now by the function PasswordDlg().  (shame on me..)

   * The argument "quant" in CutQ has been renamed to "probs", according to the naming in quantile.
   * PlotFdist has a new option "curve" to be used to add e.g. a normal density curve to the histogram.

   * StrPad has been given recycling power for all arguments. The "str" argument has been renamed to "pad".
   * The argument "type" in MeanCI, MeanDiffCI, MedianCI, VarCI has been renamed to "method" 
     such as to be consistent with others CIs.
   * The argument verb in Desc.table has been renamed to "verbose" and its allowed values to "medium",

   * DescWrd would not have run on Word versions other than German because of a local template name.
     This should be fixed for all language versions now.

   * Corrected a bug in BinomCI identified by Steven Kern in the modified Jeffreys interval for binomial proportions.
   * AddConnLines confused the space argument between horiz=FALSE and horiz=TRUE.
   * shapiro.test would have stopped the Desc procedure, if a variable had only identical values.
     This has been corrected so, that the error message will be printed, while the function Desc will 
	 proceed to describe remaining variables.
   * PoissonCI was not yet fully implemented.	 
  

OTHER NOTES:
   * Updated the NEWS file.
