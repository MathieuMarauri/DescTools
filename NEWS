     now be FALSE by default.
   * PlotFdist gets a new argument args.curve.ecdf allowing to superpose
     a function to the ecdf-plot.
   * PlotFdist's default argument for the bw of the density curve changes to
     bw = "SJ", which turns out to be the better default for n < 1000.
   * Large and Small have been recoded in C++ (thanks to Nathan Russel) to run
     faster and get a renamed argument (na.last instead of na.rm).
     So far they may be the fastest on the market.
   * PartCor has been renamed to CorPart, as it can be better found with that name.
   * Format gets a new format code "eng" for engineering format.
   * StrDist gets an additional method "normalized levensthein".
   * PlotMultiDens gets an additional parameter fill for coloring the areas.
   * PlotWeb gets a lwd argument for defining freely the lined widths.
   * In Recode the argument newlevels is replaced by the dots argument. This
     is the same rationale as in Rename.
   * Numerous updates in help files.

BUGFIXES:
   * Desc for variables with only one value won't raise an error any more.
   * Conf for rpart will find the reference now.

------------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * Lookup wraps the function "match" offering a slim interface.
   * New options "lang", "stamp" and "PalDefault" available. "lang" defines the

   * BreuschGodfreyTest for autocorrelation integrated.
   * VarTest implements a one sample chisquare test for variance.
   * New plot function for binary tree in PlotBinTree.

   * WrdParagraphFormat can be used to define a paragraph format in Word.
   * WrdFont and WrdFont<- replace old WrdSetFont and WrdGetFont
   * ToWrd wraps some old Wrdxyz functions and can be used to beam objects
     from R to Word. This will replace WrdText and WrdTable functions in future.

UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * Desc.table for higher dimensional tables gets its ChiSquare test back again.
   * Several corrections and adaptations to the help files.
   * GoodmanKruskalTauA has been renamed to the more specific GoodmanKruskalTau.
   * StrAlign gets a new interface for left, right and center alignment. See help.
   * AddMonths has been splitted in two: AddMonths (for dates) and AddMonthsYM for integers.
     The ceiling option has been removed, as it was useless. All the rest of the
     arguments are now being recycled.
   * RoundM has been renamed to RoundTo.
   * PlotRCol has been renamed to ColPicker and gets a new argument "locator".
   * Desc has been conceptually rewritten to follow clearer S3 class design and
     to be more consistent in the arguments (while improving performance).
     A print and a plot method are now available. PlotDesc(x) has
     therefore been replaced by plot(Desc(x)).
     (I fear this has the potential to break your code, I apologise for that ...)
   * The class interfaces .default, .formula etc. are by default not exported anymore.
     This applies to the function PageTest, LeveneTest, JonckheereTerpstraTest,
     CochranTest, HotellingsT2Test, DunnTest, DunnetTest, MosesTest, NemenyiTest,
     PostHocTest, YuenTTest, ZTest, SignTest, RunsTest, ScheffeTest,
     MeanDiffCI, Format, Label, Rev, Sort, PercTable, Lc, EtaSq, PlotArea,
     PlotMultiDens, PlotBubble, PlotViolin, Lc, LOCF, Untable, WrdTable.
     Use methods and/or DescTools:::MyTest.default to address, if in rare cases needed.

   * StrRight and StrLeft will accept negative n number of characters for cutting
     characters either right or left.
   * ToWide can now merge several parts of a data.frame by a key.
   * PlotLines gain new arguments pch, pch.col, etc. for superposing points.
   * DunnTest gets an "alternative" argument, the default p-value changes from "one-sided"
     to "two-sided".

   * PlotFdist displays the mean and its confidence intervall by default in the boxplot.
   * BarnardTest and BartelsRankTest have other alternative options.

BUGFIXES:
   * Documentation of GoodmanKruskalTau cited the wrong formula.
   * Corrected gcc-UBSAN issue with big integers in GCD.
   * PlotDot mistakenly reversed the order of labels, when defined as vector and did not
     handle groups correctly.
   * Hmean reported an error, when supplied with a NA vector, instead of simply
     returning NA and shut up.
   * Desc.numeric would not always have sorted the whole vector, which in some cases
     resulted in incorrect unique and extreme values.
   * StrAlign would not alwas have trimmed white space on the right side.

KNOWN PROBLEMS / TODOS:
   * Leading zeros and big.mark can not be used together in Format.
   * DoCounts should get an O(n log(n)) implementation, containig std. errors.
   * We have not reached our goal yet - documentation is still not finalized, some functions
     not tested thoroughly enough, others have rather a proof of concept status -
     but we are well on our way to achieving it. Systematic check over all
     function interfaces, ensuring consistency with R-standards and DescTools
     conventions will be performed next.

DEFUNCT:
   * WrdTable will now do the job of old WrdAddTable.
   * WrdGetFont and WrdSetFont have been replaced by WrdFont and `WrdFont<-`

   * PlotDesc.table will interpret col1, col2 as a vector of colors for the two mosaics,
     instead of two colors spanning a color ramp.
   * MarginTable has been renamed to Margins, to delimit it from margin.table.

   * ZTest has been extended with the option to handle 2 sample tests in the same manner as t.test.
     Moreover a formula interface has been added.
   * PpAddSlide will now set a newly inserted slide as active slide.
   * The artificial data.frame d.pizza has been given more structure between the variables.


BUGFIXES:
   * AddLm(x, y, ...) created the wrong formula x ~ y instead of the correct y ~ x model.
   * Corrected bug in function StrDist: wrong initialisation for Levenshtein distance.
   * Corrected a bug in BinomCI identified by Steven Kern in the modified Jeffreys interval
     for binomial proportions.
   * AddConnLines confused the space argument between horiz=FALSE and horiz=TRUE.
   * shapiro.test would have stopped the Desc procedure, if a variable had only identical values.
     This has been corrected so, that the error message will be printed, while the
     function Desc will proceed to describe remaining variables.
   * PoissonCI was not yet fully implemented.


OTHER NOTES:
   * Updated the NEWS file.
