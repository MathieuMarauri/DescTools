-----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * Outside operators, e.g. %][%, are checking if values lie outside a given range.
   * StrPos gives the first found position of a string in another string.
   * LOF yields the local outlier factor (Breuning, 2000) of a matrix using k neighbours.
   * NPV and IRR calculate the Net Present Value and the Internal Rate of Return.
     OPR calculates the one period simple or log returns.
   * DiffDays360 calculates the difference of two dates using the 360-days algorithm.
   * Vigenere implements a simple vigenere encryption algorithm.
   * Some more time functions added: Now, Today, Hour, Min, Sec.
   * IsLeapYear tests what it promises to.
   * HmsToSec, SecToHms convert h:m:s times to seconds and vice versa.
   * UnitConv convert some commonly used units.
   * MixColor gets a mixture of two colors.
   * Trim cuts extreme values from a vector x as used for calculating a trimmed mean.
   * Stuart-Maxwell computes a marginal homogeneity test. LehmacherTest does the same.
   * ScheffeTest returns the results of a multiple comparisons Scheffe test.
     NewmanKeulsTest does the same based on Tukey's HSD test.
   * PostHocTest is a wrapper for the most frequently used post hoc tests in ANOVA, 
     including FisherLSD, Bonferroni (Dunn), TukeyHSD, (Student-)Newman-Keuls and Scheffe.
   * New function EtaSq calculates the effect sizes for ANOVAs.	 
   * Several new tests added: HotellingsT2Test, BartelsRankTest.
   * Keywords reports the keywords of a manual page.
   * SysInfo displays some information about system and environment.
   * Recyle recyles a list of elements to the maximal dimension found in the whole list.
   * The function Explore(data.frame) allows a little bit of interactive plotting.
   * PlotFct helps to plot mathematical expressions or functions.
   * ToLong, ToWide are two simple functions for reshaping a vector.
   * Mar allows to set single plot margins while leaving the others unchanged.
   * New data: d.period contains the Periodic System of the Elements.
   * ParseSASDatalines reads SAS datalines in a data.frame.
   * MarginTable wraps margin.table and calculates all of them, percentages included.

   
UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * PlotHorizBars gains new arguments "height" and "add".
   * PlotQQ includes a qqline now.
   * Bivariate Desc-functions gain a plotit argument.
   * Between operators will accept multiple ranges making them more flexible.
   * The runs test has been extended to 2 samples (Wald-Wolfowitz-Test). The p-value is 
     now calculated exact for small sample sizes.
   * Kurt and Skew, computing kurtosis and skewness, are running 15-times faster using C-code.	 
   * Lorenz curves will now report Gini coefficient.
   * The function "AddErrBars" has been renamed to "ErrBars".
   * The function "AddLm" has been redesigned to "lines.lm".
   * The function "AddLoess" has been redesigned to "lines.loess".
   * AddConnLines has been renamed to "ConnLines" and gains a new argument xalign, which allows
	 to add lines to a barplot which are aligned to the middle of the bars.
   * The argument "quant" in CutQ has been renamed to "probs", according to the naming in quantile.
   * PlotFdist has a new option "curve" to be used to add e.g. a normal density curve to the histogram.
   * AndersonDarlingTest calculation logic was replaced with the newer Marsaglia approach.
     (I'm not sure, whether this was wise. Tell me what you think about that!)
   * JarqueBeraTest gains a new argument *robust*, calculation a robust version of the test.
   * StrPad has been given recycling power for all arguments. The "str" argument has been renamed to "pad".
   * The argument "type" in MeanCI, MeanDiffCI, MedianCI, VarCI has been renamed to "method" 
     such as to be consistent with others CIs.
   * The argument verb in Desc.table has been renamed to "verbose" and its allowed values to "medium",
     "low" and "high". Anyhow this change will not break existing code, as abbreviation is allowed.
   * Desc-functions have been cleared out, resulting in better consistency and faster and more robust behaviour.
   * LOCF gets a faster implementation.
    
   
BUGFIXES:
   * Bug corrected for Cramer's V confidence intervals. 
     Credits to Steven J. Pierce for spotting the problem and to Michael Smithson for fixing it.
   * The icon file for the PasswordDlg could not be found resulting in the dialog not being displayed.
   * PlotFdist did not handle args.boxplot = NA correctly, meaning no boxplot being displayed.
   * Hmean will report NA if any x < 0.
   * LsFct did not only list the functions but all objects of a package.
   * StrChop did not chop the last part of the string correctly.
   * DescWrd would not have run on Word versions other than German because of a local template name.
     This should be fixed for all language versions now.




DescTools 0.99.7 (2014-05-03)
-----------------------------

NEW FUNCTIONS ADDED:
   * MoveAvg calculates the moving average of a vector x.
   * WrdInsTab creates a table in a MS-Word document (Windows only).
   * Large/Small return the kth largest/smallest values of a vector x.
   * PtInPoly checks whether points lie within a defined polygon or not. (credits to SDMTools)
   * IsWeekend does what you'd expect it to.
   * StrAbbr abbreviates strings from the right while ensuring that they remain unique.
   * PalDescTools collects a few more palettes.
   * BinomDiffCI yields the confidence interval for a difference of proportions.
   * Outlier returns a vector of values marked as outliers in boxplot.
   * StrVal extracts all numbers out of a string.
   * SampleTwins draws a sample with comparable strata properties.
   * PasswordDlg brings up a dialog to enter a password while displaying only ***.
   * KendallW calculates Kendall's coefficient of concordance.
   * KrippAlpha calculates Krippendorfs' Alpha reliability coefficient. 
   * PlotQQ plots a QQ-plot for a variable with an assumed distribution.
   
   
UPDATED FUNCTIONS:
   * PlotGACF will not plot ACF(0) any more. Lags instead of phases will be used for ts-objects as x-axis.
   * Desc.integer looses its maxlevels argument and gains "maxrows" and "freq". See help.
   * TukeyBiweight gains a na.rm argument and has been changed to use .Call instead of old .C function.
   * MeanDiffCI gains a formula interface.
   * HighLow uses a more efficient algorithm, based on the function Large/Small.
   * PlotWeb gains a couple of new arguments, making it more flexible.
   * AreaIdent gains a new argument poly. With poly=TRUE a polygon instead of a
     rectangle can be used to select the interesting points.
   * PlotCorr gains a border and lwd argument, allowing a grid being added.	 
   * ZTest has been extended with the option to handle 2 sample tests in the same manner as t.test.
     Moreover a formula interface has been added.
   * PpAddSlide will now set a newly inserted slide as active slide.
   * The artificial data.frame d.pizza has been given more structure between the variables.
    

BUGFIXES:
   * AddLm(x, y, ...) created the wrong formula x ~ y instead of the correct y ~ x model.  
   * Corrected bug in function StrDist: wrong initialisation for Levenshtein distance.
   * Corrected a bug in BinomCI identified by Steven Kern in the modified Jeffreys interval for binomial proportions.
   * AddConnLines confused the space argument between horiz=FALSE and horiz=TRUE.
   * shapiro.test would have stopped the Desc procedure, if a variable had only identical values.
     This has been corrected so, that the error message will be printed, while the function Desc will 
	 proceed to describe remaining variables.
   * PoissonCI was not yet fully implemented.	 
  

OTHER NOTES:
   * Updated the NEWS file.
